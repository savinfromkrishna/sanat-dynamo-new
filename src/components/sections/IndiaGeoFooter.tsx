 *
 * Why this exists: /in/en/services and the other primary pages were stuck
 * in Search Console's "Discovered, not indexed" bucket — Google knew the
 * URLs but didn't think they were worth crawling. The fix has two parts:
 *  (1) Internal link weight pointing into the indexable city pages.
 *  (2) Page-unique content at the bottom of every primary page so Google
 *      stops folding /services, /industries, /about etc. as templated
 *      near-duplicates of the home page.
 *
 * Both parts are addressed here. The block is gated to /in/en — the only
 * country/locale combo in INDEXABLE_COUNTRIES × INDEXABLE_LOCALES — so we
 * don't burn bytes rendering a 50-link block on pages that ship `noindex`.

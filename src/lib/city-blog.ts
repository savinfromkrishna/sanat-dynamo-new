/**
 * Per-city blog. One starter post per metro — handwritten, opinionated,
 * keyword-rich, and locally anchored. The shape mirrors the global blog
 * (`./blogs.ts`) but is kept separate so each city's blog has its own
 * URL space (`/cities/{slug}/blog/{post-slug}`) and Search Console signal.
 *
 * Why separate:
 *   1. SEO — the city URL space inherits localBusiness + city schema, so
 *      "{topic} in {city}" intent searches resolve here, not the global blog.
 *   2. Content — these posts reference the metro's neighborhoods, language,
 *      and stack. They wouldn't read right under /blogs.
 *   3. Editorial — adding posts under `/cities/{slug}/blog` doesn't pollute
 *      the global blog category mix.

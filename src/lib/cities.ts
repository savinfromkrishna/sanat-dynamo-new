/**
 * Per-city content for the Indian metros we explicitly target.
 *
 * Each city gets its OWN URL (`/in/en/cities/{slug}`) with hand-written,
 * locally-anchored copy. This is the SEO play: Google demotes thin/duplicate
 * "doorway" city pages, so every entry below is ~600+ words of unique text
 * referencing real neighborhoods, industries, and pain points the city is
 * known for. Don't reduce these to templates without local detail — that's
 * what got the previous attempts demoted.
 *
 * Adding a new city:
 *   1. Append a new `CityContent` entry to `INDIA_CITIES`
 *   2. Make sure `slug` is lowercase, ascii, hyphenated
 *   3. Write at least 4 hand-written FAQs and 2 paragraphs of local context
 *   4. Push the deploy and submit the URL in Search Console for indexing
 *
 * **Hindi indexability** — pages render in Hindi via `localizeCity()` only
 * when a `translations.hi` block exists AND `bodyLocales` includes "hi".
 * The global INDEXABLE_LOCALES gate in [src/lib/constants.ts](src/lib/constants.ts)
 * is "en"-only, but `isCityIndexable(city, locale)` overrides per-city, so a
 * single city with real Hindi body re-enters the /in/hi index without
 * flipping the global lever and re-exposing all the fake-Hindi pages we
 * demoted on 2026-05-09.

        answer:
          "No — Google has been explicit about this. E-E-A-T is a concept used by their human quality raters to evaluate search results. But the signals behind E-E-A-T — author bylines, expertise markers, trust indicators, genuine reviews — are measurable and do feed algorithms via proxies.

        question: "What does the second 'E' (Experience) mean?",
        answer:
          "Experience was added in late 2022 to account for first-hand knowledge. A review of a hotel written by someone who stayed there has more E-E-A-T than one written by an AI summarizer. For SMEs the implication is: ship case studies, customer stories, and lived-experience content rather than generic how-tos scraped from elsewhere.",

      {
        question: "Does E-E-A-T apply to all content or only YMYL?",
        answer:
          "It applies universally but carries more weight for YMYL (Your Money Your Life) topics — health, finance, legal. SMEs in clinics, legal services, or financial services should treat E-E-A-T as non-negotiable. SMEs in lifestyle or entertainment have more latitude.",

The signals behind E-E-A-T are measurable, and they feed the model via proxies.",

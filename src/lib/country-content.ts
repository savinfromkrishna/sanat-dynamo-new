/**
 * Per-country content for the 12 target markets.
 *
 * This is the data layer that makes each country variant GENUINELY different —
 * not just title/meta personalization. Google's near-duplicate detector looks
 * at the visible body text; when >60% of that text is identical across URLs,
 * it consolidates the variants and only indexes one. The fields here feed
 * into section components so that `/us/en` and `/de/en` render materially
 * different copy, stats, case-study selection, FAQ, and CTAs.
 *
 * Content tiers:
 *   T1 — fully hand-written (in, us, gb, ae)
 *   T2 — templated core + country-specific bullets (ca, au, sg, de)
 *   T3 — lighter localization, still unique hero + trust block (fr, es, nl, sa)
 *
 * Add new markets by adding a new `CountryContent` entry and the country code
 * to `TARGET_COUNTRIES` in `constants.ts`.
 *
 * Industry keys match `t.industries.items[].id` in translations:
 *   ecommerce, real-estate, edtech, healthcare, sme-erp
 * Case-study slugs match `t.caseStudies.items[].id`:
 *   d2c-skincare, real-estate-developer, manufacturing-erp

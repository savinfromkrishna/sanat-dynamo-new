    {
      q: "Why not just upgrade to Tally Prime or use a SaaS like Zoho / SAP B1?",
      a: "Tally Prime still caps at 2 concurrent users on Silver and 10 on Gold, and its production module is bolt-on at best. Zoho Inventory and SAP Business One work, but they force your shop floor into their schema — BOM, routing, and costing are pre-fitted to a generic manufacturer. Our builds are custom: we model your specific routing, costing, and dispatch flow, then layer Tally migration on top. You keep your existing books and add the operational layer Tally was never designed to handle.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does GST e-invoicing and e-way bill work in this system?",
      a: "Every B2B invoice above the e-invoicing threshold automatically generates an IRN via the NIC IRP API at the moment of finalization. E-way bills are generated against the IRN at the dispatch step — your stores manager triggers it from the same screen they pack the order. Both run on a queue with retry logic, so a brief NIC outage never blocks dispatch. GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B exports are one-click for your CA.",
    },
    {
      q: "We're a textile manufacturer in Ahmedabad — do you understand textile-specific workflows?",
      a: "Yes. Ahmedabad textile manufacturers we've worked with run on multi-stage process flows — greige → dyeing → printing → finishing → packing — each with its own job card, rejection capture, and costing per metre. We've modeled colour-batch tracking, shade-card matching, and customer-specific quality specs. We're particularly active in the Naroda, Narol, and Vatva clusters.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle the parallel-run with Tally so our books don't break?",
      a: "For the first 60–90 days post go-live, every transaction is recorded in both systems. Your accountant continues filing GST and ITR from Tally exactly as before. We reconcile daily and surface any divergence within 24 hours. Cut-over to the new system as the system of record happens only after three consecutive months of clean reconciliation. CAs who've worked with us before sign off on the cut-over date.",
    },
    {
      q: "What does this cost — capex or subscription?",
      a: "Build is fixed-price scoped during a 1-week paid discovery (typically ₹2.5L–₹4L for the discovery alone). The ERP itself is one-time licensed to your company — we don't lock you into a per-seat SaaS. Hosting and our ongoing operations retainer is monthly (₹40K–₹1.2L/month depending on transaction volume). Most clients break even against their old Tally + accountant overflow inside 12 months.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can it run on the patchy internet at our factory?",
      a: "Yes. The shop-floor mobile app works offline-first — production logs, material issue, and rejection capture queue locally and sync when connectivity returns. The web ERP runs on the office network with a low-bandwidth fallback. We've shipped to factories in Vapi, Bharuch, and Kanpur where 3G is the best you get most days.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you support batch / lot tracking and expiry for chemical / pharma / food manufacturers?",
      a: "Yes. Batch / lot is a first-class entity in the inventory module — every GRN creates a batch, every issue consumes from a batch (FIFO or specified), and every dispatch carries the batch numbers on the packing list. Expiry tracking with auto-quarantine of expired stock is supported, and we integrate with GS1 barcoding for batch labels.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will the Founder / CFO actually look at this every day?",
      a: "Yes — because the founder dashboard is built for a phone, not a desktop. It shows daily revenue, gross margin, cash position, top 5 SKUs by margin, top 3 stockouts, and the day's dispatch list. Five seconds of glance, every morning. The founders we've shipped to open it before they open WhatsApp.",

      q: "How fast can we get the lead-routing live?",
      a: "Lead-routing CRM is the fastest module — typical go-live is 4–6 weeks from contract. Project microsites and local SEO content take longer (10–14 weeks for a full build) but the lead-routing change alone usually shows a CPL drop inside the first 30 days.",

      q: "What does this cost?",
      a: "1-week paid discovery (₹2L–₹3.5L) scopes the build. Implementation is fixed-price, typically ₹8L–₹35L for a complete CRM + microsite + local SEO build, depending on number of projects and partner depth. Ongoing nurture + content retainer runs ₹40K–₹1.5L/month.",

    {
      q: "Will Google find our project pages — we have terrible SEO right now?",

Most developer sites have one project page per project; we ship 30–80 long-tail SEO pages per project covering locality, configuration, possession-month, builder-reputation, and price-trend queries. Combined with structured data, internal linking, and high-quality content, ranking for 'flats in {locality}' or 'plots in {phase}' becomes realistic within 3–4 months.",

      q: "We use Practo today — do we have to leave it?",
      a: "Not immediately. Most clients keep Practo as one of several inbound channels for the first 6 months and gradually shift acquisition to direct + Google. The system we ship works alongside Practo; once direct + organic bookings exceed Practo bookings (typically 3–4 months in), most clinics drop Practo or downgrade to a minimal listing.

      a: "We design EMR for clinical reality: two screens, three taps. Specialty templates pre-fill 60–70% of fields. Voice-to-text in English / Hindi / Gujarati / Kannada / Tamil. We've onboarded 60-year-old senior consultants who refused every prior EMR — they're using ours daily inside 2 weeks.

We've consistently moved clinics from 12 reviews/year to 100+ within the first 6 months.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will this rank our clinic for 'dentist near me' kind of searches?",
      a: "Yes — local SEO is the highest-leverage channel for clinics. We optimize Google Business Profile (NAP consistency, hours, services, photos, GBP posts, Q&A), build per-location landing pages with schema markup, and run review velocity. Within 3–4 months most clients reach top-3 in their primary local-pack for their specialty. We'll show you live examples of clinics we've ranked.",

Indian medical-record retention requirements (8 years) are baked in.",

    {
      q: "We have 6 locations — does this scale?",

We've shipped to 10-location dermatology and 6-location dental chains. The central ops team sees per-location and roll-up dashboards.",

  intro: [
    "Indian coaching institutes are stuck in the messiest moment of the offline-to-hybrid transition. The flagship classroom is full. Demand for online + recorded is rising. The website is a brochure built in 2018. Inquiries come on the phone, get scribbled in a register, and 60–70% never convert because nobody followed up. Fees are collected in cash or NEFT — Razorpay is on the to-do list. Live classes happen on Zoom links shared on WhatsApp. Attendance is taken on a printed sheet. The institute is growing, but every additional student adds disproportionate operational drag.",
    "We build the system that fixes this stack-wide. A website that converts inquiry-to-demo-class instead of being a PDF brochure. Razorpay-integrated fees with EMI / installment / sibling discount logic that India actually uses. LMS with live class, recorded library, doubt-clearing, mock tests, and per-batch analytics — usable by a 14-year-old on a 4G phone. Local SEO that ranks for 'NEET coaching in {city}', 'JEE coaching near me', 'UPSC mentor {state}'. Parent-facing dashboard so the parent (who's paying) sees what they're paying for.",

  faq: [
    {
      q: "We're a JEE / NEET / UPSC institute with 800 offline students — does this fit us?",
      a: "Squarely. The 200–5,000-student offline-first institute going hybrid is the median case we ship for. Your existing classroom flow continues unchanged; we layer the website + Razorpay + LMS + parent dashboard on top so the online channel scales without disrupting offline. Most clients in this band are at 70:30 offline:online when we engage and 50:50 within 12 months.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you build a custom LMS or use existing platforms (Teachable, Thinkific, Graphy, Classplus)?",
      a: "Depends on scale. Below 200 students or if you're testing online demand, we'll often start on Graphy / Classplus / Teachmint with a custom website on top — fastest time to market. Above 500 students or if your live + recorded + mock + parent dashboard needs are non-standard, we build custom because the per-seat cost of SaaS LMS becomes prohibitive and the LMS becomes the thing capping your differentiation.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does Razorpay EMI work for a ₹2L coaching fee?",
      a: "Razorpay supports EMI on credit cards (3/6/9/12 months), no-cost EMI on select cards, and BNPL via Simpl / LazyPay. We integrate all three plus a custom installment plan (e.g., 4 cheques over the academic year) tracked in the institute dashboard. Sibling discounts, scholarships, and partial refunds are configured per institute policy. Razorpay reconciliation runs daily into the books.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will this rank our institute on Google for 'NEET coaching in {city}'?",
      a: "Yes — local + course-specific SEO is one of the highest-leverage channels for coaching. We build 30–80 landing pages per institute (per city, per course, per locality, results-focused, faculty-focused) with structured data, internal linking, and content depth. Combined with Google Business Profile and review velocity, top-3 ranking for primary city + course queries is realistic in 4–6 months.",
    },
    {
      q: "What about online creators selling cohorts at ₹50K–₹2L per seat?",
      a: "That's a different shape — fewer students, higher per-seat economics, application-style funnel. We build the application + cohort-launch landing page, payment + scholarship logic, cohort LMS (live + replays + Slack/Discord community + assignment grading), and a graduation / referral flow. Scales from solo creator to 5-cohort academy.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you integrate with our existing student management system (Tally, Vedantu, Toppr internal)?",
      a: "Usually yes via API or CSV bridges. The pattern that works best is: keep the SMS / accounting system as the system of record for finance + audit, and run the website + LMS + parent dashboard as the student-facing surface, with daily sync. Avoids ripping out core systems your accountant relies on.",
    },
    {
      q: "How fast can we go live?",
      a: "Website + Razorpay + inquiry funnel: 4–6 weeks. LMS (live + recorded + mock test + parent dashboard): 8–12 weeks. Local SEO content engine: 12–16 weeks for full ramp. Most institutes see enrollment-cycle improvement in the first 60 days from inquiry funnel + Razorpay alone.",
    },
    {
      q: "What does it cost?",
      a: "Discovery: ₹1.5L–₹3L. Build: ₹6L–₹35L depending on whether you need custom LMS or SaaS-LMS integration. Retainer: ₹40K–₹1.2L/month for SEO content, automation maintenance, and seasonal admission cycles. Most institutes break even on the build inside 1 admission cycle from the demo-to-paid lift alone.",
